# Breed_Plant
Things to do for main.js:
-get the images to show up above the general structure
-getting the images to be placed correctly 
    --make image dimensions not hard coded
-getting rid of center images (at the base of branches)
-draw a bunch of different stuff
    --draw full plants that you "discover" --> cacti
-come up with a few different starter plants? 
-playing with coloration for the structure
-figuring out having multiple plants on a vue screen with separate canvases
-flower probability and levels battle

(maybe) making an image editor or something to take an image and change the colors?
